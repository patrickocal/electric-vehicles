\emph{1. Do you agree with the objectives and do you think
they will achieve our proposed goals? Are there other objectives we should
consider?}

Basic economic principles tell us that the host of policies that we choose to
implement in Australia should result in market participants internalising the
social costs.  The right notion of social cost goes beyond the emission of
greenhouse gases, to include costs of with not actively participating in the
global community's transition to net zero.  Although Australia's carbon
footprint is small on an aggregate level, on a per capita level it is large.

The economically efficient means to achieving a global net-zero emissions
target by 2050 is unequivocally a uniform carbon price
(UCP).\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com/articles/526315a}\\

} A UCP is an essential signal for economic agents that reduces the need for
sector and region-specific subsidies, taxes and regulations that may distort
agent behaviour and lead to higher costs of transition.  The over-arching goal
of Australian government policy should be to coordinate across departmental and
sectoral divisions to strive towards a suitable UCP.  Although a global UCP is
unattainable in the near future, it is still \emph{the} normative benchmark
relative to which we should measure and judge our policies. Moreover, we should
encourage policies that put us on a path towards a global UCP.

It is against this background that we address each of the proposed objectives
(in bold) on page 6 of the consultation paper.

\paragraph{Objective: encourage rapid increase in demand for EVs} We argue that
if policies are to rapidly increase demand, then they should also rapidly
increase supply.  Otherwise, this objective carries the risk of increasing
prices of EVs relative to ICEs.  In particular, if supply is unable to keep up
with demand, then current prices will increase and send the wrong signal to
future buyers. Since only one in every 70 cars sold globally 


Furthermore, ordination is needed to ensure that there are no
major knock-on effects outside the sector. We will discuss further the
conditions under which it is possible to achieve an increase in Australian
demand without significant increases to EV prices below.

\paragraph{Objective: increase supply of affordable and accessible EVs to meet
demand across all segments.} We broadly agree with this objective. We recommend
that this is achieved by

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item
opening up the market to independent importers of new and used cars: this would
encourage new market entrants and competition to benefit of lower EV prices.

\item
bringing Australian fuel efficiency standards into line with other major
markets so as to avoid distortions.

\end{enumerate}

The main potential adverse effect of such a policy is the following. If car
prices (ICE and EV) fall relative to energy-efficient modes of collective
transport, then this might lead to an increase in car usage and an inefficient
increase in energy. The resulting upward pressure on electricity prices might
then slow the process of electrification more broadly.

\paragraph{Objective: Establish the systems and infrastructure to enable the
rapid uptake of EVs.}
This too, we broadly agree with.

\emph{In achieving the objectives of the Strategy, we will address barriers to EV
uptake such as:
}

\paragraph{Barrier to uptake: Limited availability of affordable EV models
across all vehicle types}

\paragraph{Range anxiety due to gaps in EV charging networks and hydrogen
refuelling infrastructure }

Information for consumers.

\emph{2. What are the implications if other countries accelerate EV uptake
faster than Australia?}

\emph{3. What are suitable indicators to measure if we are on track to achieve our
goals and objectives?}

\emph{4. Are there other measures by governments and industry that could increase
affordability and accessibility of EVs to help drive demand?}

\emph{5. Over what timeframe should we be incentivising low emission vehicles
as we transition to zero emission vehicles?}

\emph{6. What information could help increase demand and is Government or industry
best placed to inform Australians about EVs?}

We are seeking views on how vehicle fuel efficiency standards could be
implemented in Australia. If these standards are implemented, they will need to
be designed specifically for Australia. However, evidence also suggests that
standards that lack ambition will continue to leave Australia at the back of
the queue for cheaper, cleaner new vehicles. Feedback is sought on options for
a robust model. We will draw from the experience in other markets and consider
Australiaâ€™s unique circumstances.

Vehicle fuel efficiency standards need to be:

\paragraph{Effective in reducing transport emissions}

\paragraph{Equitable so all Australians can access the vehicles they need for work and
leisure}

\paragraph{Transparent and well explained to avoid unintended consequences}

\paragraph{Credible and robust by drawing on expert analysis and experience}

\paragraph{Enable vehicles with the best emissions and safety technology to be available
to Australians.} 

Initially, we are seeking views on:

\emph{7. Are vehicle fuel efficiency standards an effective mechanism to reduce
passenger and light commercial fleet emissions?}

\emph{8. Would vehicle fuel efficiency standards incentivise global manufacturers to
send EVs and lower emission vehicles to Australia?}

\emph{9. In addition to vehicle fuel efficiency standards for passenger and light
commercial vehicles, would vehicle fuel efficiency standards be an appropriate
mechanism to increase the supply of heavy vehicle classes to Australia?}

\emph{10. What design features should the Government consider in more detail for vehicle fuel efficiency standards, including level of ambition, who they should
apply to, commencement date, penalties and enforcement?}

\emph{11. What policies and/or industry actions could complement vehicle fuel
efficiency standards to help increase supply of EVs to Australia and electrify
the Australian fleet?}

\emph{12. Do we need different measures to ensure all segments of the road transport
sector are able to reduce emissions and, if so, what government and industry
measures might well support the uptake of electric bikes, micro-mobility and
motorbikes?}

\emph{13. How could we best increase the number of affordable second hand EVs?}

\emph{14. Should the Government consider ways to increase the supply of second hand EVs independently imported to the Australian market? Could the safety and
consumer risks of this approach be mitigated?}

\emph{15. What actions can governments and industry take to strengthen our
competitiveness and innovate across the full lifecycle of the EV value chain?}

\emph{16. How can we expand our existing domestic heavy vehicle manufacturing and
assembly capability?}

\emph{17. Is it viable to extend Australian domestic manufacturing and assembly
capability to other vehicle classes?}

\emph{18. Are there other proposals that could help drive demand for EVs and provide
a revenue source to help fund road infrastructure?}

\emph{19. What more needs to be done nationally to ensure we deliver a nationally
comprehensive framework for EVs?}

\emph{20. How can we best make sure all Australians get access to the opportunities
and benefits from the transition?}
