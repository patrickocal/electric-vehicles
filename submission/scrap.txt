 
The key to increasing
demand is to increase the surplus EVs provide Australian buyers and owners of
cars relative to the surplus associated with ICEs. 

The benefits less the costs of purchasing and
owning an EV.  research (Menezes et al) has shown that one of the most
effective ways to increase demand is to subsidise car purchases. 

The main issue with this objective is that, in
isolation, a rapid increase in demand may lead to a large increase in the price
of EVs. Australia has a relatively small share of the global car market, so the
impact on global prices of domestic policies will be insignificant. Local
prices, however, are another matter. If local supply is inelastic, then
policies such as subsidies will mainly serve to increase local margins (and
hence profits) on imported cars rather than demand itself.
